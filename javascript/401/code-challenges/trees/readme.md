## Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Space and time efficiency

## It has O(n) time efficiency because it has to scale through the whole tree so it will scale with n as it grows.

## It has O(1) space efficiency because it only has to track the max value so it will be linear

## How can we read all values in a Tree

## Depth First: Read all the sub children on one side of the tree, before reading children of the other side

## Pre Order: Current Node -> Left Subtree -> Right Subtree

## In Order: Left Subtree -> Current Node -> Right Subtree

## Post Order: Left Subtree -> Right Subtree -> Current Node

## Breadth First: Read all nodes on the current level, before traversing to subtrees

## The efficiency for preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder are all O(n) because it cycles through the tree once so it scales with n
